## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.11.3
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 7.4.0
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same instructions as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
* IO2D
  * Installation instructions for all operating systems can be found [here](https://github.com/cpp-io2d/P0267_RefImpl/blob/master/BUILDING.md)
  * This library must be built in a place where CMake `find_package` will be able to find it
* After compile IO2D dont forget to install running `cmake --install .` from inside the Debug directory

## Compiling and Running

### Compiling
To compile the project, first, create a `build` directory and change to that directory:
```
mkdir build && cd build
```
From within the `build` directory, then run `cmake` and `make` as follows:
```
cmake ..
make
```
### Running
The executable will be placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the project as follows:
```
./OSM_A_star_search
```
Or to specify a map file:
```
./OSM_A_star_search -f ../<your_osm_file.osm>
```

## Testing

The testing executable is also placed in the `build` directory. From within `build`, you can run the unit tests as follows:
```
./test
```

### Debugging with VSCode

In addition I list below the steps used to debug this project using VS Code and [here](https://youtu.be/pThGzmT0C7E) is a video showing the steps.
1.	Create a .vscode directory in your project directory
2.	Copy the launch.json file (you see in the video) inside the .vscode directory
3.	Make sure you have the Makefile file in your project directory
4.	Run the commands
  4.1 "make clean" and "make debug"
5. The first command will cleanup unnecessary files and second command will generate your monitor project in debug mode
6. Open VS code inside the project directory
7. Set a breakpoint in a cpp file you want to stop
8. Click Debug > Start debugging
9. The program will stop in the first breakpoint

And voila, happy debugging!
